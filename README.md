# Ask from PDFs using Gemini

## Description

This project allows users to ask questions about the content of PDF documents. By using Google Generative AI and FAISS for managing text data, the application lets you upload PDF files, process their content, and get answers to your questions based on the information in the PDFs. If the answer isnâ€™t available in the PDF, the app will let you know politely.

## Features

- Upload and process multiple PDF files.
- Extract text from PDFs.
- Break text into smaller chunks for better handling.
- Generate text embeddings using Google Generative AI.
- Store and retrieve text embeddings with FAISS.
- Ask questions about the PDFs and receive detailed answers.
